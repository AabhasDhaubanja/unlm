            <p>Land of Buddha. Land of Culture.</p>

            <p>
              The idea for UNML came from the symbol of unalome. It represents
              the path to enlightenment in the Buddhist culture. Life is full of
              twists and turns and thatâ€™s what the spirals in the symbol
              symbolise, and the straight line is the moment one reaches peace.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hence the idea for UNLM was born- to connect people through the
              symbol of unalome- through art of lifestyle- wherein one finds
              peace and harmony in chaos- the art of finding comfort.
            </p>

            <p>
              UNML is all about representing lifestyle and culture through
              apparel and accessories.
